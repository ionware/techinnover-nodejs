# Techninover Node.js Backend Test
To simply things and make it straight to the point, I implement this function in a low level approach since only one endpoint is required, and with minimal operations. Also, instead of heavily using an ORM (such as Sequelize), I simply use MySQL package.

**NOTE**: This project is directly build with GCP Cloud Function focus, but of course, a Native Node.js HTTP server is fine to run the App.
